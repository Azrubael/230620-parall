A few examples of the implementation of parallel execution of tasks using processes, threads and simultaneously processes and threads:

* threads_basic.py  # simple concatenated and concurrent threads
* threads_arr.py    # simple array of concurrent threads
* threads_next.py   # threading vs multiprocessing

* cpu_bound.py      # the global interpreter lock blocks full-fledged threading
* io_bound.py       # this is an example of the effective threading
